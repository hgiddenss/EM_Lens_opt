# EM_Lens_opt
Dielectric lens optimisation using ML 

This code optimizes the dielectric constant distribution of a EM lens antenna and builds a ML model which can predict the far field resposne based on the pixel map of the lens.

Requires MaxwellFDFD to perform simulations which can be cloned here https://github.com/wsshin/maxwellfdfd

Still a working
